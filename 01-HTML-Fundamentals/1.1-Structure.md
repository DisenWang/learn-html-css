# What is HTML?
HTML is the language used to create the web pages you visit everyday. It provides a logical way to structure content for web pages.

Let's analyze the acronym "HTML", as it contains a lot of useful information. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.

A markup language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text. Markup languages work by surrounding raw text with information the computer can interpret, "marking it up" for processing.

HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links, also known as “hyperlinks”. In fact, you probably clicked on many, many hyperlinks on your path to this Codecademy course!

In this course, you'll learn how to use the fundamentals of HTML to structure, present, and link content. You'll also learn how to use CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, to style the HTML content you add to web pages.

Let's get started!

# !DOCTYPE
A web browser must know what language a document is written in before they can process the contents of the document.

You can let web browsers know that you are using the HTML language by starting your HTML document with a document type declaration.

The declaration is the following:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

This declaration is an instruction. It tells the browser what type of document to expect, along with what version of HTML is being used in the document. `<!DOCTYPE html>`must be the first line of code in all of your HTML documents.

**Note**: If you don't use the doctype declaration, your HTML code will likely still work, however, it's risky. Right now, the browser will correctly assume that you are using HTML5, as HTML5 is the current standard. In the future, however, a new standard will override HTML5. Future browsers may assume you're using a different, newer standard, in which case your document will be interpreted incorrectly. To make sure your document is forever interpreted correctly, always include `<!DOCTYPE html>` at the very beginning of your HTML documents.

# Preparing for HTML
Great! Browsers that read your code will know to expect HTML when they attempt to read your file.

The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration is only the beginning, however. It only tells the browser that you plan on using HTML in the document, it doesn't actually add any HTML structure or content.

To begin adding HTML structure and content, we must first add opening and closing <html> tags, like so:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

</html>
```

Anything between `<html>` and `</html>` will be considered HTML code. Without these tags, it's possible that browsers could incorrectly interpret your HTML code and present HTML content in unexpected ways.

# HTML Anatomy
Before we move forward, let's standardize some vocabulary we'll use as you learn HTML. Here are some of the terms you'll see used in this course:

1. Angle brackets - In HTML, the characters `<` and `>` are known as angle brackets.
2. HTML element (or simply, element) - HTML code that lives inside of angle brackets.
Opening tag - the first, or opening, HTML tag used to start an HTML element.
3. Closing tag - the second, or closing, HTML tag used to end an HTML element.
4. Closing tags have a forward slash (`/`) inside of them.

With the exception of a few HTML elements, most elements consist of an opening and closing tag.

In the following example, there is one paragraph element, made up of one opening tag (`<p>`) and one closing tag (`</p>`):

```html
<p>Hello there!</p>
```
